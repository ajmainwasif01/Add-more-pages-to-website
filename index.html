    <h2><center>Chinese cuisine</center></h2>
    <p>
        Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which includes cuisine originating from the 
        diverse regions of China, as well as from Chinese people in other parts of the world. Because of the 
        Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines 
        in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, 
        noodles, tea, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide.
